// Regression for the inherited todo-9 defect: #releaseSlot was guarded by a task_id-only Set that
// was never reset, so a revived task that re-acquires a slot could never release it again (the
// later release collapsed to a no-op) and leaked the slot forever. The guard is now keyed by
// run_epoch, so each revive's occupancy releases independently.
