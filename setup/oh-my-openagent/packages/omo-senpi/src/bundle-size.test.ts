// PLAN TARGET (todo 17e): the built omo.js must stay at or under 700,000 bytes.
//
// The extension inlines every component's third-party dependency tree into ONE non-split file
// (zod v4 ~477 KB, jsonc-parser ~263 KB, vscode-jsonrpc ~229 KB, posthog-node ~175 KB, js-yaml ~100 KB),
// so an unminified build is ~1.28 MB. The budget is met by minifying that single-file output
// (measured ~695 KB): a within-file, semantics-preserving transform that leaves the one-file loader
// topology unchanged - unlike code-splitting, which emits sibling chunks and would require live Senpi
// loader validation this focused repair cannot perform. `bundle-purity.test.ts` still enforces the
// peer/leak boundary against the minified import shape, so minification cannot silently smuggle a
// non-peer dependency past the guard.
