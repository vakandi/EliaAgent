/* Derived sync view-model — barrel re-export of the split modules.

 * people-derivations.ts, sync-view-model.ts) during the UI god-file
 * decomposition; this file now only re-exports the public API so
 * call sites in the sync tabs, state.ts, and the test file stay on
 * the same import path. */
