# Linux Coordinator E2E Runbook

Use this runbook to validate the built-in TypeScript coordinator on Node/Linux before adapting the flow to Cloudflare.

This is an **Advanced/operator** validation path. The normal user workflow is **Projects → Sharing → Devices → Health**; coordinator groups and direct sync are compatibility and deployment mechanics.

Use this path to prove the coordinator-assisted delivery path end-to-end:

1. start the coordinator
2. create a group
3. generate an invite
4. join from a second device
5. inspect the discovered device in Advanced
6. confirm Project access and delivery in Devices/Health
7. run a direct sync only when diagnosing

If this flow does not work on a clean Linux/Node setup, fix that first. Do not blame Cloudflare for bugs that already
exist locally.

## Assumptions

- one reachable Linux machine will run the coordinator
- two codemem devices will join the same coordinator group
- the coordinator is reachable from both devices (direct IP, Tailscale Funnel, or Cloudflare Tunnel)

## 1. Start from clean coordinator state

On the coordinator host:

```fish
rm ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
codemem coordinator group-create my-team --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
set -x CODEMEM_SYNC_COORDINATOR_ADMIN_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32)
codemem coordinator serve --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite --coordinator-host 0.0.0.0 --coordinator-port 7347
```

If you do not want to expose the raw host directly, put it behind Tailscale Funnel or Cloudflare Tunnel and use that
public URL in the next steps.

## 2. Configure the admin device

On the device that will create invites:

```json
{
  "sync_enabled": true,
  "sync_coordinator_url": "https://coord.example.com",
  "sync_coordinator_group": "my-team",
  "sync_coordinator_admin_secret": "<same admin secret from the coordinator host>"
}
```

Use a coordinator URL the teammate device can actually reach.

If you create an invite with a LAN-only, localhost, or Tailnet-only URL, codemem now warns about that, but it will not
block you because private-network deployments can still be valid.

## 3. Create and share an invite

On the admin device:

```fish
codemem coordinator create-invite my-team --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
```

This returns:

- a pasteable encoded invite string
- a link form of the same payload
- optional warnings if the coordinator URL looks network-scoped

Share the encoded invite with the teammate device.

## 4. Join from the teammate device

On the teammate device:

```fish
codemem coordinator import-invite <encoded-invite>
```

Expected result:

- `sync_coordinator_url` is configured automatically
- `sync_coordinator_group` is configured automatically
- if the invite uses `auto_admit`, enrollment completes immediately
- if the invite uses `approval_required`, the teammate sees a pending state until approval

The invite import path now uses a more reasonable timeout than the old brittle 3-second default, but if it still times
out, check reachability of the invite’s `coordinator_url` from the teammate machine before doing anything else.

## 5. Approve join requests if needed

If the invite policy is `approval_required`, on the admin host:

```fish
codemem coordinator list-join-requests my-team --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
codemem coordinator approve-join-request <request-id> --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
```

## 6. Inspect the discovered device (Advanced)

After both devices are enrolled and posting presence, open **Advanced → Sync** (or the compatible `#sync` route).

Expected state:

- the teammate appears in **Coordinator-discovered devices**
- the coordinator's group membership does not itself grant Project access

For a legacy/direct-peer workflow, on the device that should pair with the teammate:

1. click **Accept peer** in Team sync
2. codemem creates the local `sync_peer`
3. the UI hands you off to the legacy scope editor in **Advanced**

If the discovered peer conflicts with stale local state, Team sync currently shows a note that the repair/removal needs
to happen in **Advanced**. Fix or remove the conflicting local peer there, then return to Team sync and accept the
discovered device again once the row refreshes.

## 7. Confirm Project delivery

For the normal teammate workflow, share exact Projects in **Sharing**, then inspect **Devices** and **Health**:

- the device has an owning **Identity**
- Projects shared directly appear in **Devices** under **Direct Projects**
- Team recipient intent appears in **Sharing**; authoritative per-device Team eligibility remains in Team policy administration
- an unavailable device is **Waiting**, not failed
- **Needs attention** means a terminal setup failure and exposes a retry action

Coordinator enrollment, `sync_peers`, scopes, Space grants, addresses, fingerprints, filters, epochs, and cursors are Advanced/operator diagnostics. They must not be used as the proof of normal Project access.

Removing Project access prevents future delivery; it cannot retract memories already delivered to a device.

## 8. Trigger a direct sync (Advanced diagnostics)

In **Advanced**, click **Sync now** for the new peer.

Current behavior:

- a successful click means the sync run was started, not that it has already completed
- the UI refreshes local sync status once after the trigger
- legacy scope review can still warn after the trigger; resolve it in Advanced before relying on the direct-peer path

## 9. Verify the result

Good signals:

- the peer moves from stale/offline to healthier status over time
- sync attempts appear in the diagnostics surface
- the receiving device actually gets the expected memories

Useful checks:

```fish
codemem sync peers
codemem sync attempts --limit 10
curl "http://127.0.0.1:38888/api/sync/status?includeDiagnostics=1"
```

## Common failure modes

### Invite imports but join times out

The invite probably embeds a coordinator URL the joining machine cannot reach.

Recreate the invite with the real public or shared-network URL.

### Join succeeds but coordinator requests return `invalid_signature`

You likely have stale coordinator enrollment state for that device id.

Reset or repair the coordinator DB entry and try again from a clean state.

### Peer is discovered but still not syncing

That can still mean:

- the peer was not accepted yet
- legacy scope review is still pending
- the local peer entry is stale or conflicting
- the direct peer address is unhealthy even though coordinator discovery works

Use the Team sync note plus Advanced diagnostics to inspect and repair the actual peer state.

## Exit criteria

Treat the Linux/Node path as validated only when all of this is true:

- teammate can import the invite successfully
- devices appear in coordinator discovery
- discovered device can be accepted into `sync_peers`
- Devices shows the owning Identity and direct Project access; Sharing shows Team inheritance
- Health distinguishes waiting from needs-attention recovery
- a direct sync run is triggered successfully
- data actually replicates between devices

Once this flow is solid, the next step is a Cloudflare compatibility/adaptation pass rather than more guesswork on the
basic coordinator behavior.
